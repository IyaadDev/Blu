## Introduction
The Blu API has many features which will be described later, such as:
- Text completion
- Talking to AI

You currently cannot personally obtain an API key, instead, you may use a demo pre-loaded account.
This works as a regular key, although it is prefilled weekly up till 23 tokens.
